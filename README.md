## OOP Principles Applied

| Principle | Where |
|---|---|
| **Abstraction** | `User` is abstract; `Trackable` and `Processable` are interfaces |
| **Encapsulation** | All fields are private; accessed only via getters/setters |
| **Inheritance** | `Customer`, `Vendor`, `DeliveryPartner`, `Administrator` all extend `User` |
| **Polymorphism** | `getRole()` overridden in every subclass; `Trackable` and `Processable` used generically |
| **Single Responsibility (SRP)** | Each class has one reason to change; service layer handles orchestration |
| **Open/Closed (OCP)** | New user types extend `User` without modifying it |
| **Liskov Substitution (LSP)** | Every `User` subtype can be used wherever `User` is expected |
| **Interface Segregation (ISP)** | `Trackable` and `Processable` are small, focused interfaces |
| **Dependency Inversion (DIP)** | Services depend on abstractions (interfaces) not concrete classes |

## Design Pattern Mapping

The table below maps the required 4 patterns, including creational, structural, behavioral, and one framework-enforced pattern.

| Pattern | Category | Where Implemented | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Factory Method | Creational | `OrderItem.fromCartItem(...)` creates `OrderItem` from `CartItem` | [src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/model/OrderItem.java](src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/model/OrderItem.java) |
| Adapter (Mapper-style) | Structural | `ProductMapper` adapts between domain model and persistence entity | [src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/service/ProductMapper.java](src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/service/ProductMapper.java) |
| Observer / Event Listener | Behavioral | Swing event callbacks via `MouseAdapter` in custom UI components | [src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/gui/components/StyledButton.java](src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/gui/components/StyledButton.java) |
| Repository (Spring Data JPA) | Framework-enforced | Spring repositories extend `JpaRepository` and are injected into services | [src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/persistence/repo/ProductRepository.java](src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/persistence/repo/ProductRepository.java), [src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/SpringApp.java](src/main/java/com/quickcommerce/SpringApp.java) |

## UML Relationships Implemented

| Relationship | Classes | Multiplicity |
|---|---|---|
| Inheritance | User ← Customer / Vendor / DeliveryPartner / Administrator | — |
| Composition | Cart → CartItem | 1 to 1..* |
| Composition | Customer → Cart | 1 to 1 |
| Composition | Order → OrderItem | 1 to 1..* |
| Composition | Order → Payment | 1 to 1 |
| Association | Customer → Order | 1 to * |
| Association | DeliveryPartner → Order | 1 to 0..* |
| Association | Vendor → Product | 1 to * |
| Association | OrderItem → Product | * to 1 |
| Association | CartItem → Product | * to 1 |

## How to Build & Run

This project is a Spring Boot application that launches a Swing UI. The build uses Maven and targets Java 17.

### Requirements
- Java 17 (JDK 17)
- Maven 3.6+

> The app is launched by Spring Boot (`com.quickcommerce.SpringApp`). Spring is used to wire services; the GUI runs on the AWT Event Dispatch Thread (EDT). The Spring Boot plugin repackages the app as an executable JAR.

### Build (PowerShell)
```powershell
# From the project root (where pom.xml is)
mvn -DskipTests clean package
```

### Run (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Run via Spring Boot (runs on the EDT and opens the Swing UI)
mvn spring-boot:run

# Or run the packaged jar after building
java -jar target\QuickCommerceApp-1.0.0.jar
```

### Run from an IDE
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**
2. Ensure the project SDK is set to **Java 17** and Maven import completes
3. Run the Spring Boot application `com.quickcommerce.SpringApp` (Run as Java Application / Spring Boot)

### Troubleshooting
- If the UI does not appear, ensure the JVM is not running in headless mode. The app sets headless=false in `SpringApp`.
- If Maven fails to download Spring artifacts, check your network/proxy settings or run `mvn -U clean package`.

## Demo Flow (Main.java)

When you run the application, it simulates a complete grocery delivery workflow:

1. A **Vendor** registers and lists 5 products (Milk, Bread, Eggs, Rice, Chocolate)
2. A **Customer** logs in and adds items to their cart
3. The customer places an **Order** and pays via **UPI**
4. The **Vendor** confirms the order
5. A **Delivery Partner** is auto-assigned by the `OrderService`
6. The delivery partner marks the order as **Delivered**
7. The customer **tracks** the order
8. A **second order** is placed and then **cancelled** (demonstrating stock restoration)
9. The **Admin** generates a full report and monitors active orders

---

## Extending the Project

- **Add a database layer**: Replace the in-memory `List<>` stores in each service with JPA repositories
- **Add a REST API**: Wrap each service with a Spring Boot `@RestController`
- **Add Spring Security**: Integrate with the existing `login()` / `logout()` logic
- **Add a Notification system**: Implement an Observer pattern to email/SMS customers on status changes
